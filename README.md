# GeometryGame
This app leverages basic OOP concepts of python to create a game where 2 random coordinates of a rectangle are generated.
Main goal of the game is for user to guess a coordinate (x,y), such that it should fall inside the coordinates of the rectangle.
User can also guess the area of the rectangle formed and if guessed wrong, user is displayed the message of by how much his guess was off by.
Update- Adding a GUI for simpler gameplay using turtle
